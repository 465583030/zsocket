Todo List
---------
1. Multi frame writes (frames that are larger than one frame)
2. Faster checksum code (let's get some assembly going)
3. Faster byte to native type inet code (again a little assembly probably)
3. Separate host types to include unsigned types and signed types (in inet)
4. More net type implementations (e.g. UDP, etc)
5. Fix Loss Disabled option
5. Add BPF support
